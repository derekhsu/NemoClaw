"""Relocate the pinned Hermes cron execution ledger into writable runtime state.

Hermes v2026.8.27 / 0.20.6 resolves ``cron/executions.db`` lazily inside
``cron/executions.py:_connect`` (``EXECUTIONS_FILE`` is now an optional test
override) and shares the same database with ``cron/incidents.py``. When
Shields up is active, NemoClaw correctly seals ``cron`` as the high-risk
location for cron job definitions, so a managed gateway restart cannot reopen
that database.

NemoClaw already provisions ``HERMES_HOME/runtime`` as the descriptor-verified
cross-identity lifecycle boundary. Patch the execution ledger, the incident
writer that shares it, and the Hermes quick snapshot inventory together so
only the mutable audit database moves while cron job definitions remain
sealed. The exact source-shape checks fail closed when the pinned Hermes
implementation changes.

Remove this patch when the minimum supported Hermes release separates mutable
cron execution history from cron job definitions.
